A dasymetric map seeks to display statistical surface data by exhaustively partitioning space into zones where the zone boundaries reflect the underlying statistical surface variation. The process of dasymetric mapping is the transformation of data from a set of arbitrary source zones to a dasymetric map via the overlay of the source zones with an ancillary data set. In practice, dasymetric mapping is often considered a particular type of areal interpolation technique where source zone data are excluded from certain classes in a categorical ancillary data set. Dasymetric mapping is applicable to a wide variety of tasks where the user seeks to refine spatially aggregated data, for example in estimating local population characteristics in areas where only coarser, regional resolution census data are available. This tool addresses the design, implementation, validation, and application of a new ‘intelligent’ dasymetric mapping (IDM) technique that supports a variety of methods for characterizing the relationship between the ancillary data and underlying statistical surface. The technique is referred to as intelligent because an analyst may establish this relationship subjectively using their own domain knowledge, extract this relationship from the data using a novel empirical sampling technique, or combine the subjective and empirically-based methods.

This toolbox contains a number of scripts that assist preparing vector population and raster ancillary datasets for intelligent dasymetric mapping, performs the dasymetric calculations, and then generates a floating point output raster of revised population density. Please see the documentation on the individual tools for more information. 

To add this toolbox to ArcToolbox, right click on the ArcToolbox folder at the top of the list of toolboxes and choose "Add Toolbox..."  From the Add Toolbox dialog, navigate to this folder and select the Dasymetric_Toolbox.tbx file and click OK.  The toolbox will be added and will reference the associated python scripts using relative paths.  Please make sure that the scripts and the toolbox file remain in the same folder.  

For more information on the individual scripts and processes, please reference the help for each individual tool or the html help docs in this folder.
