<h1>RasterScripts 1-3 - Prepare for Dasymetric Calc</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This model combines the first three pre-processing steps in the raster dasymetric mapping routine.  First, it converts a polygon feature class to an integer raster using the ObjectID of the feature class for the value of the output raster.  Next, it combines the population raster and an ancillary raster and creates a standalone table for dasymetric calculations.  Last, it creates a standalone table that can contain preset density values for all the unique classes in the ancillary dataset.  After the table is created, it will need to be manually populated with preset density values, and classes that should not be preset should be removed from the table.</p><br><p>
<h2> Usage Tips</h2>
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We tried allowing the user to designate a field that would become the raster cell values, but found that ArcGIS handled this field differently depending on the formats of the input file and the output raster. Always using the field ArcGIS recognizes as the ObjectID field eliminated this inconsistency. A user may specify their own population key field, and this field will be included in the output population raster and population working table, but it will be included only for the convenience of the user, not for any functional part of the script. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In this script the ancillary raster is used only to determine the spatial reference and cell size of the output population raster so that the two rasters are aligned when they are combined in the next script. In most cases the ancillary raster is a land-use or land-cover dataset. The cell assignment type is likely only relevant if the cell size is large relative to the population areal units, and any choice other than the default (Cell_Center) significantly adds to processing time. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have tested ESRI GRIDs and File Geodatabase Rasters most thoroughly as output formats, though other standalone raster formats should work as well. Problems tend to arise (if at all) when the attribute tables start to reach format limits. Please let us know if you experience problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>The output table will contain ancillary class values, the count of the number of pixels in that class, and a new column with floating-point type called PRESETDENS, which represents estimated people per pixel. It is most common for this function to be used to specify zero population for certain classes (it's often a safe assumption that water or snowfield areas have zero population). Setting such classes to zero helps refine density estimates in the intelligent dasymetric mapping. You may finish preparing this table in at least two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first way to populate this table is to add it to ArcMap, start an edit session with the table as the target, and type density values into the PRESETDENS column, then save and stop the edit session. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you choose a standalone .dbf file as the output for this tool, you may also use Microsoft Excel as an editor for the table. If you choose this option, please be sure to only edit the one column, and save the document as dbf again. </li>
</ul>
<p>You should remove rows from the table corresponding to those classes for which you do not wish to provide estimates (you would prefer their densities to be calculated via intelligent dasymetric mapping).</p><br></div>
